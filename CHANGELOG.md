## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.7](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-basic/compare/v0.0.6...v0.0.7) - 2026-05-06

### Other

- reframe FFI claim — HW-engine crates use OS FFI by necessity
- drop stale REGISTRARS / with_all_features intra-doc links
- drop dead `linkme` dep
- auto-register via oxideav_core::register! macro (linkme distributed slice)
- unify entry point on register(&mut RuntimeContext) ([#502](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-basic/pull/502))

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-basic/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.6) - 2026-05-03

### Other

- replace never-match regex with semver_check = false
- migrate to centralized OxideAV/.github reusable workflows
- add YUV4MPEG2 demuxer + muxer
- drop unused PcmDecoder.sample_rate field (slim-frame leftover)
- adopt slim AudioFrame shape
- pin release-plz to patch-only bumps

### Added

- Y4M (YUV4MPEG2) raw-video demuxer + muxer (`y4m` module). Handles
  4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 / mono at 8/10/12-bit, preserves header
  `X<key>=<val>` extensions in `Demuxer::metadata`, and probes on the
  `YUV4MPEG2 ` magic. Frames are emitted as `rawvideo` packets.

### Other

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-basic/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4) - 2026-04-19

- migrate register() to CodecInfo builder
- bump oxideav-core + oxideav-codec deps to "0.1"
